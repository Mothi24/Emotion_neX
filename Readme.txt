Hello this is our first project Emotion neX
You can find the working prototype of our project at feelings.html

DESCRIPTION

    Project Name
        Emotion neX
    Problem It Solves:
        Our Project helps people who got stuck in a same mood for a long time and who looks for a change in scenery. 
        This application recommends Books, Movies, Songs, Web series according to how the user wishes to change his mood. 
        We will develop this application like a social media application and make people with a similar mindset come into a community and make them forget their lonliness.
        Since there aren't many apps in use that bring people with similar interests together we believe this could fill up a need in application usage. 
        Since we aim to a totally useful one we did not include anything that could become a waste of time for the user.
    Obstacles We Ran Into
        Since we are just freshers and this is our first hackathon , we lack experience which is our major obstacle .
        We have not come across advanced level in any programming language and we tried our best with what we had.
